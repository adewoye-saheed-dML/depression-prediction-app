## Overview

This project addresses a critical issue in student mental health by developing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of depression. Early identification can lead to timely intervention, for better academic performance and well-being.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Model selection and evaluation.
3. Deployment-ready implementation for further integration.

## Features

- **Predictive Analysis**: Predicts whether a student is likely to be depressed or not.
- **Interpretability**: Provides insights into key factors contributing to predictions.
- **Scalability**: Designed for potential integration with larger systems for monitoring student well-being.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Docker**: For containerizing and deploying the application.
