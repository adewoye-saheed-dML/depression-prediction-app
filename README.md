## Overview

This project addresses a critical issue in student mental health by developing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of depression. Early identification can lead to timely intervention, for better academic performance and well-being.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Model selection and evaluation.
3. Deployment-ready implementation for further integration.
